### Johns Hopkins University Coursera: Data Science Specialization
### Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
### Tidied Data Sets of Human Activity Recognition

*Takashi Yonenaga 15/06/2020*


## 1. Summary

This Coursera final project is derivative of the project conducted by the Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, 
which conducted experiments to capture 3D motions of participants through a smartphone attached to their bodies.
This Coursera project prepares summarised version of the data obtained in the experiments.

The original data set, along with their full descriptions, can be found at the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0).

## 2. About Original Experiments and Data Set
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

**For each record it is provided:**  
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.  
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
- Its activity label.   
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.  

**The dataset includes the following files:**  
- 'README.txt'  
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.  
- 'features.txt': List of all features.  
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.  
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.  
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.  
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.  
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.  
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  


**Notes:**  
* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  
* Each feature vector is a row on the text file.  
* The data of inertial signals were not used in this project, although the data are saved in the project folder.


## 3. Project Specification: Cleaning the Original Data

Using R, the project creates two tidy data sets from the original data:  
- Data 1 "har_merged.txt": a data set that contains means and standard deviations of measures collected. It includes all subjects and activities.  
- Data 2 "har_summarised.txt": summarised version of Data 1 by subject and activity.  

Here are the steps taken to prepare the two data sets.  
**Data 1 har_merged.txt**  
1. Prepare descriptive variable names using 'features.txt' in the orignal data set.
2. Load the original test and train data sets. For each, attach the subject data (1 to 30) and activity (e.g. "walking", "laying", etc.) data to the measure data set.  
3. Combine the test data set (data of 9 participants) and the training data set (data of 21 participants) into a single data set.  
4. Extract only the data of means and standard deviations out of all the statistical measures (e.g. mean, max, min, etc.) of participants' motions.  

**Data 2 har_summary.txt**  
5. Summarise means and standard deviations by subject and activity.
